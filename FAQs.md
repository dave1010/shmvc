## What are SHMVC's aims?

- Easy to set up and create a basic app
- Extendibility (plugins) and extensibility (ready for future development)
- Speed (many requests per second)
- Lightweight (only a few kb to get a fully working site)
- Introduce people to PHP 5.3's namespaces and the HMVC design pattern
- Have an extensive test suite (PHPUnit)
- Drop in to an existing project, without conflicting with anything

## Why Hierachial?

MVC is great but web pages are a collection of nested MVC blocks.

## Why not CodeIgniter / Kohana / Symphony / Zend / FUEL / ... ?

SHMVC has different aims.

## Is it ready for production?

Not yet.

## How can I help?

Test it, report issues, submit pull requests, write documentation.
